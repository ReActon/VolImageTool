The program will compile by typing make, after files are extracted.
The program can then be run by typing: ./volimage MRI
and then the required flags.

For instance if you want to create a diffmap of the images from point x to point y,
the leading flag must be '-d' and there has to be two separated numbers followed by
the output file name of your own selection.
An example input for this option is thus: ./volimage MRI -d 10 25 output

If you wanted to extract an image, you must precede with a '-x' flag followed by the image
number you wish to extract. This image is then viewable using the python viewer that is included 
in the submitted files.
An example input is this: ./volimage MRI -x 40 output
Following which: python viewer.py output.raw 429 303 will allow you to view the resultant image
of those dimensions of image number 40. The name before the .raw extension is whatever filename
was inputted after the image number.

Finally not including any flags or files or numbers will result in the internal representation
being built and the number of images along with the number of bytes required to store these
images will be displayed.
